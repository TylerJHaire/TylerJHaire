Hey there! I'm Tyler Haire and I'm Computer and Data Scientist!
My experience is mainly in front-end mobile applications and data science focussed projects.
Additionally I've had experience with the back-end of systems both in terms of managing endpoints and the writing business logic for querying data.
Having worked primarly for a startup my strongest skill is learning new techniques, languages, conventions, etc. in order to solve the problem.
As such my main strengths are in mobile and web development, UI design, and statistical analysis and data science applications.
Language wise I'm proficient in Python, Java, C, and Dart. I've also had working experience with C#, Type Script, HTML, and Swift.

My main focus - apart from being the best software engineer I can be - is to become a great leader of a strong team of fellow engineers.
I love the team and buisness aspects of software problems and aim to become an effective project manager as soon as I can.
